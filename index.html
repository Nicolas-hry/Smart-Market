			<h2>1. Smart Market's Ideology</h2>
			<p>“What is the difference between a used iPhone and a refurbished iPhone? »
				In both cases, these are two devices that have already been used. But the comparison stops there. Indeed the refurbished iPhone has been checked and restored to perfect condition in a factory, before being resold on Smart Market (or another site necessarily a little less good). This refurbished phone therefore has the double advantage of being a cheap and excellent quality smartphone.
				On Smart Market, do you only find refurbished tablets and smartphones?
				No. This is a bit of the problem of the moment, moreover: many think that the subject is confined to phones and tablets. While almost everything is now refurbished (from printers to computers, to washing machines). Our role is to facilitate your access to these products.</p>
